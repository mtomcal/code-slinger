# Test

A little test environment to make sure this tool is working correctly. It should be unix and windows compatible.

## Do This First

```bash
# We need rimraf dep
npm install
```
## Next

Test using package.json npm commands:

```bash
# Do a local npm install and run bootstrap and
# run react-server to see if it fails
npm start

# Use ../app.js to do a quick test to see if
# bootstrap and react-server work.

npm test

# Test production bundling
npm run build
```
